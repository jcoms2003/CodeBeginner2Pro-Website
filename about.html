            My name is Joshua Comstock, I am a current student at American
            Public University working towards my BS in Computer Science.
            Computers have intrigued me for almost as long as I can remember.
            About four years ago I had a good friend express their interest in
            computers, since they remembered I had always had the passion to
            learn about them. It was that day I was introduced to the first
            resource I am going to share with you all on this website. This
            website is called W3Schools. This was the first step I took in
            learning about coding and computers. I spent some time learning some
            code from their free online tutorials. After about a year of on and
            off coding, I hit a point where I thought it was just to difficult
            and took a break for a while. However, again thanks to this friend I
            had, he had me get into an introductory Python course at a local
            community college. This class is what finally solidified my passion
            for computers and coding. Since then, I have been scavenging the
            internet and people for information on free resources to teach code
            and computers. I have spent a lot of time finding all these free
            resources so I thought why not make a website where beginner
            computer geeks can find a bunch of helpful information all in one
            place!

            Currently I am studying for an AS in computer technology which I
            will then transfer over to a BS in computer science. I have received
            coding certifications in HTML and CSS through W3Schools and an
            currently working on my JavaScript certification. I have also taken
            classes on Python, PHP, SQL, and some C. I have also enjoyed
            tinkering with my Arduino Uno and Cisco Packet Tracer. Eventually I
            hope to be proficient with networking and full stack development in
            order to land a decent job in the tech industry after I transition
            out of the military.
