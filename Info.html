          <p class="indent justify">
            Coding is one of the self-learned skills in the tech industry. What
            I mean by that is that you have the resources available to you to
            learn most programming languages and scripts on your own with the
            help of free online resources. This will help set you up for success
            in the future. One of the largest and most helpful resources is
            <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank"> W3School’s</a>
            free online tutorials for practically everything! Yes, they
            literally have anything and everything to learn for free! This was
            the first resource that I used to get started and is always the
            first recommendation I give anyone that expresses interest in
            coding. You also have the ability to purchase AI monitored
            certification exams through the W3School’s website. These don’t
            expire and have outstanding credibility as one of the larges open
            source self-certification programs.
          </p>
          <p class="indent justify">
            Some other resources that are available online include: Codecadamy,
            Codefinity, GeeksForGeeks, and many more. However, I personally
            found W3Schools the most helpful and easy to use.

          <h3 class="center">Networking</h3>
          <p class="indent justify">
            Computer networking is like a roadway system going through a city,
            except it is going over the entire world. This can be a challenge to
            get practical applications due to the need for a bunch of hardware
            devices. However, I have the perfect FREE resource where you can
            practice the software and hardware side of computer networking from
            your computer! This is called
            <a href="https://skillsforall.com/" target="_blank">
              Cisco Packet Tracer</a
            >. It is a downloadable software that does an amazing job making a
            real-life practical application of computer networking. Check out
            the link on the right (or below if using a smartphone or tablet)
            under networking.

            Now, if you find an interest in Arduino or cyber security, I also
            have a few resources for you as well. Getting started with Arduino
            can be a lot of fun, from making an LED display to creating and
            programming a self-driving robot. First, you will need to get an
            Arduino Uno starter kit, you can find one on
            <a

            for about $55, which is decent considering all the components it
            includes. For cybersecurity there is an amazing website called
            <a href="https://tryhackme.com/" target="_blank">TryHackMe</a>. If
            you have not had the chance to check out this website it is a must!
            It is the infamous website where Ryan Montgomery has the number one
            hacker spot. It will break down the basics of cybersecurity and
            eventually match you up with live people to have a competitive
            hacking game. This website is a lot of fun, even if you are not
            interested in cybersecurity!
